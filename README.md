# DAI - SHIB YIELD FARM 


## PROLOGUE
This project is based on DappUniversity's project: HTTPS://github.com/dappuniversity/defi_tutorial . \n
The original project will create a yield farm for DAI - DAPP token pair. I followed his tutorial and idea then create another yield farm, DAI - SHIB
You may ask why SHIB? It's kawaii.
